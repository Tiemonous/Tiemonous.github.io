          <p class="text center">the age of consent isn't just something physical, it has nothing to do with the body being fully developed.
            <br>
            The age of consent is something mental. it stops children with undeveloped brains and understandings from making bad decisions.
            <br>
            That's why it's <b>not</b> ok to think a (for example) autistic person at the age of 18 is at the age of consent.
            <br>
            An autistic person of 18 years old has the mind of a 7 year old that's why it's <b>not</b> okay.
